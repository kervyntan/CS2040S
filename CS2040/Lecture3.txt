BINARY SEARCH
- For monotonic functions (only increase/decrease)

Binary Search is NOT just for searching arrays:
- Can use on a complicated function
- But function must be monotonic (only increasing/decreasing)

Local Maxima
- Value is greater than or equals to its left and right neighbor (Array)

key Property (Invariant):
- If we recurse in the right half, then there exists a peak in the right half.

Peak finding:
- Peak Element -> an element that is strictly greater than it's neighbors
