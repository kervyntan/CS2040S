In Java, order of growth for adding a String depends on the length of the string
eg. final = final + "?" 
vs final = final + "??" is different!!

if / else statements:
cost = max(cost of first, cost of second) <= (cost of first) + (cost of second)
Order of growth -> combination of cost of if and else bodies


**Google terms if unsure

Pre-condition (Pre-requisite for algorithm to be applied)
eg. Sorted array for binary SEARCH

Post-condition 

Loop invariant
